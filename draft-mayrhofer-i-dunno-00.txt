The Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation (I-DUNNO)
                       draft-mayrhofer-i-dunno-00

Abstract

   Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not.  Still,
   an unruly minority of mankind sticks to invading into the realm of
   machine to machine communication by reading, writing, misspelling,
   memorizing, permuting, confusing IP addresses.  This pamphlet
   specifies the Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network
   NOtation ("I-DUNNO") in order to put an end to these ludicrious
   attempts (TODO: of mankind to invade into ... repetition of above?)

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Protocol "is designed for use in interconnected systems
   of packet-switched computer communication networks" ([RFC0791]) -
   neither the word "humans" nor "users" occur in the specification,
   though they are considered indirectly as a communal whole in a
   philosophical statement: "A name indicates what we seek." - which
   clearly indicates that names rather than addresses should be of
   concern to humans.

   The specification of Domain Names ([RFC1034]), mentions "users"
   several times, and even includes the word "humans", even though is
   positioned slightly unfortunate in context of "annoying" and "can
   wreak havoc" (See Section 5.2.3 of RFC1034).  Nevertheless, this is a
   clear indication that Domain Names were made for Humans, while IP
   addresses were not.

   It appears therefore quite logical that a human-readable (textual)
   representation of IP addresses was just very vaguely specified in
   Section 2.1 of [RFC1123].  Subsequently, a directed effort to make IP
   addresses confusing was introduced in [RFC1883], and more amazing
   options to puzzle humans were offered in Section 2.2. and 2.3. of
   [RFC4291].  These early attempts to hamper efforts by humans to read,
   understand and spell IP addressing schemes were unfortunately
   jeopardized in [RFC5952].

   In order to permanently prevent humans from being able to read IP
   address notations, this document specifies the "Internationalized
   Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation" (I-DUNNO).  Ab^H^Hperusing
   the intricacies, inaccuracies and chaotic disorder of what they call

   a "Cultural Technique" (also known as "Script"), I-DUNNO expresses IP
   addresses and prefixes as a set of Unicode codepoints, TODO (using
   their own weapons against them).

   TODO: Compliance LEvels ("party pooper") - confusables, non
   printable, DISALLOWED - see below?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document MAY be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   TODO refer to RFC6919

   Additionally, the phrase "CAREFULLY CONSIDER" means that implementors
   SHALL skim the Abstract before copying the "Examples" section into
   their code.

   TODO: Definition for the two notations (the traditional "party
   pooper" notation, and the "very funny" I-DUNNO compatible notation)

3.  The Notation

   I-DUNNO leverages UTF-8 [RFC3629] to obfuscate IP addresses for
   humans.  UTF-8 uses sequences between 1 and 4 octets to represent
   codepoints as follows:

      Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
         (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
      --------------------+--------------------------------------
      0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
      0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
      0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
      0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

                                 Figure 1

   Transcoding between plain, traditional (boring) IP address notations
   and I-DUNNO is performed as follows:

3.1.  Encoding to I-DUNNO)

   In order to convert the Boring Notation of an IP address into
   I-DUNNO, the following steps are performed:

   1.  The octets of the Boring Notation are written as a bitstring in
       Network Byte order.

   2.  TODO - consider adding CIDR prefix length (rfc4632) as additional
       bits?

   3.  Working from left to right, the bitstring (32 bits for IPv4, 128
       bits for IPv6) is allocated to UTF-8 octet sequences.

   4.  Note that since the number of combinations of UTF-8 octet
       sequence sizes accomodating exactly 32 or 128 bits are limited,
       padding the bitstring for the last UTF-8 octet sequence is
       allowed (but only for the last one!).  This means that the
       bitstring may be padded with no more than 20 bits (TODO explain -
       4 octect UTF 8 is 21 significant bits - clarify text).  Content
       of padding can be chosen (TODO fix language) in order to fulfill
       requirements (see below).

   5.  The resulting sequence of UTF-8 octet sequences constitutes the
       I-DUNNO notation, and may be presented to unsuspecting humans.

3.2.  Decoding (I-DUNNO to Boring)

   TODO

4.  I-DUNNO Confusion Level Requirements

   A valid I-DUNNO MUST at contain at least one UTF-8 octet sequence
   with a length beyond one octet.  Codepoints which are currently
   allocated SHOULD be preferred over unallocated ones.  Mixing of
   Unicode scripts is RECOMMENDED, as is mixing scripts with different
   directionality.

   In order to distinguish an I-DUNNO from an IDN label, a valid I-DUNNO
   MUST contain at least one UTF-8 sequence corresponding to an IDNA2008
   DISALLOWED codepoint.

   Non printable characters are a welcome addition too, as are
   Confusables.  No code point left behind!

   The Confusion Score of I-DUNNO is calculated as follows (Note: Old
   text, TODO - replaced by text above?):

      For each UTF-8 octet sequence that corresponds to an allocated
      code point, the score is increased by the UTF-8 octet sequence
      length.

Internet-Draft           draft-mayrhofer-i-dunno              March 2018


      For each Unicode script used in the I-DUNNO, the score is
      increased by 3 points.

      For each codepoint listed as "confusable" (TODO xref), the score
      is increased by 10 points.

      For each non-printable ....

   Mixing of Unicode scripts is RECOMMENDED, as is mixing scripts with
   different directionality.

   Non printable characters are a welcome addition too, as are
   Confusables.  Contrary to Domain Names, no code point is left behind

   An I-DUNNO containing DISALLOWED characters according to IDNA2008
   (TODO xref)

5.  IANA Considerations

   In order to foster interopability, IANA is asked to revoke all IPv4
   and IPv6 allocations which cannot be represented by a valid I-DUNNO.
   Not that this might foster IPv6 deployment significantly.  Local
   Internet Registries are encouraged to follow up with similar
   policies.

   TODO: reverse delegations based on I-DUNNO?

   TODO: Recommend that RFC5513 is extended to acronyms beyond three
   characters, particularly those with Seven Letters (SLA).

6.  Security Considerations

   In tradition with many other RFCs, this exercise is left to the
   reader.
